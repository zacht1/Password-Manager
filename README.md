# My Password Manager

MyPasswordManager is an application that allows the user to store and access any account information using *one* 
universal password. The user can locally store new account information, edit previously stored account information, and 
delete old out of date account information. MyPasswordManager can help any user remember account information, and create
secure unique passwords for all their accounts.  

This project is of interest to me, because I currently do use a password manager and have always been interested in how
they securely store my passwords.  I am hoping this project will give an opportunity to learn more about security, 
privacy, and encryption.

### Features I am Hoping to Implement
- Password generator
- Password duplicate detection
- Weak password detection
