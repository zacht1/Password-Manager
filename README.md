# My Password Manager

MyPasswordManager is an application that allows the user to store and access any account information using *one* 
universal masterPassword. The user can locally store new account information, edit previously stored account information, and 
delete old out of date account information. MyPasswordManager can help any user remember account information, and create
secure unique passwords for all their accounts. 

Anybody can benefit from using a masterPassword manager. In order to keep your accounts protected your passwords must be
long, complicated and unique. This makes remembering passwords and account information for the dozens of web accounts 
you have extremely difficult, using a masterPassword manager is the best solution.

This project is of interest to me, because I currently do use a masterPassword manager and have always been interested in how
they securely store my passwords.  I am hoping this project will give me an opportunity to learn more about how 
masterPassword managers work, and how they protect users' passwords.
