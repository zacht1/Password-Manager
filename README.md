# My Password Manager

MyPasswordManager is an application that allows the user to store and access any account information using *one* 
universal masterPassword. The user can locally store new account information, edit previously stored account information, and 
delete old out of date account information. MyPasswordManager can help any user remember account information, and create
secure unique passwords for all their accounts. 

Anybody can benefit from using a masterPassword manager. In order to keep your accounts protected your passwords must be
long, complicated and unique. This makes remembering passwords and account information for the dozens of web accounts 
you have extremely difficult, using a masterPassword manager is the best solution.

This project is of interest to me, because I currently do use a masterPassword manager and have always been interested in how
they securely store my passwords.  I am hoping this project will give me an opportunity to learn more about how 
masterPassword managers work, and how they protect users' passwords.


### Features I am Hoping to Implement
- Password duplicate detection
- Weak masterPassword detection

## Phase 1 User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add an account card to my masterPassword manager 
- As a user, I want to be able to add any account information to an account card 
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the account cards in my masterPassword manager 
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the account information in any of my account cards 
- As a user, I want to be able to delete an account card from my masterPassword manager 
- As a user, I want to be able to edit any account information of an account card
- As a user, I want to be able to copy a masterPassword to the clipboard without using ctrl+c
- As a user, I want MyPasswordManager to generate strong passwords of any length for me

## Phase 2 User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to load my masterPassword manager from file when I give the correct masterPassword
- As a user, I want my masterPassword manager to automatically save to file when I close the application
